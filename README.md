# Ubuntu_setup_scripts
These are the scripts I use to set up my Ubuntu. They install tools for Web development and ML and work with Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and WSL2 Ubuntu. Some portions are untested.
These scripts are largely inspired by https://github.com/rsnk96/Ubuntu-Setup-Scripts. Some of the code is taken directly from there. 
For a list of useful commands and tips, check out [help](Help.md)

## Scripts
